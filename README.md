Elma
===

Elma is an event loop and process manager for embedded and reactive systems. Elma is structured as a C++ library of classes on top of which you build your own C++ project. It keeps track of processes, finite state machines, events, and communication channels, executing them at specified frequencies. Elma was developed as part of the University of Washington's [ECE P 520 course](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520) on advanced embedded systems programming. More information on how Elma was designed can be found in the links below:
- [Event loop management](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520/tree/master/week_6)
- [Events and finite state machines](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520/tree/master/week_7)

Installation
===

The source code for Elma [is on Github](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma).

From Dockerhub
---

To get started, you will need a C++ build environment. We have provided one with the Docker container `elma`, which you can use as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/klavinslab/elma.git
    cd elma
    docker run -v $PWD:/source -it klavins/elma:latest bash
    make
    examples/bin/basic

From the Dockerfile
---

You can also build the docker environment, described in env/Dockerfile, yourself, with the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/klavinslab/elma.git
    cd elma
    docker build -t myelma .
    docker run -v $PWD:/source -it myelma bash
    make
    examples/bin/basic

Manual Installation
---

To install Elma without using Docker, you will need to install the following tools:
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 4.9 or an equivalent C/C++ compiler that supports at least C++14
- Make (if you want to use the makefile. Alternatively, you can use some other build manager)
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/)
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Neils Lohmann's JSON library: https://github.com/nlohmann/json
- [My fork](https://github.com/klavins/cpp-httplib.git) of [yhirose](https://github.com/yhirose)'s HTTP library

Installation on Unix systems (e.g. Raspbian)
---

First install required packages available through apt-get

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y cmake
    sudo apt-get install -y cppcheck
    sudo apt-get install -y graphviz
    sudo apt-get install -y doxygen
    sudo apt-get install -y cmake
    sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev

Next, install Google Test

    cd /usr/src
    sudo git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
    cd googletest
    sudo mkdir install
    cd install
    sudo cmake ../
    sudo make
    sudo make install

Next, install the json library

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/json
    cd /usr/local/include/json
    sudo curl -O -J -L https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.5.0/json.hpp
    sudo mv json.hpp json.h

Next, install httplib

    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/klavins/cpp-httplib.git
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/httplib
    sudo mv /tmp/cpp-httplib/httplib.h /usr/local/include/httplib

Now you should be ready to install elma:

    cd ~
    mkdir Code
    cd Code
    git clone https://github.com/klavinslab/elma.git
    cd elma
    make

Note that the Makefile should detect if you are on a pi by using the command

    uname -m

which on a pi 3 model B+ returns 'armv71'. If your pi is different, you might need to change the ifeq statments in `test/Makefile` and `examples/Makefile`.

If you would like to treat elma as a library, so you can link in other code, you should link to the relevant files in to the unversal system resources (usr) as follows:
```bash
ln -s include /usr/local/include/elma
ln -s lib/libelma.a /usr/local/lib/libelma.a
```
Then you can do 
```c++
#include "elma/elma.h"
```
in your code and use the `-lelma` flag while linking. See the [example elma project](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma_project) for an example.

Usage
===
See the examples in the `examples` directory for how to build new event loops with Elma.
